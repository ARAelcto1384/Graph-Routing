# Graph-Routing
This project is a project introduced by the discrete professor (Dr. Laleh Armi).
It is a graph project where we have to specify a source and a destination to find the shortest path according to an algorithm, which is Dijkstra's algorithm in this case.
It is in Java.
Of course, due to lack of time, it is not completed and does not work for all graphs. But it includes most graphs.
